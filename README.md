USAGE:
    Binoculo [-v] --range host_notation --port port(s) [--output output] [--write write] [--read read]
    Binoculo --version
    Binoculo --help

FLAGS:

    -v        Verbosity level                                                                                                

OPTIONS:

    --range             CIDR or IP range: 192.168.1.0/24 or 192.168.1.0..192.168.1.255                                       
    -p, --port          Port(s) to scan: 80,443,8080 or 80-8080 or 21,80-8080                                                
    -o, --output        Output file                                                                                          
    -w, --write         Write cutom payload to socket, e.g: GET / HTTP/1.1                                                   
    -r, --read          Save only responses that match with this string, e.g: Apache                                                                                   
```

## Usage
There is a "binoculo" bash script that you can run:

- Start meilisearch container
- Start front dashboard to filter and visualize results
- Run binoculo via docker for ease of use

**The command below runs via docker**
```
$ ./binoculo -r 192.168.101.1/24 -p 21,22 --output my_result.txt
```

Finishing the scan you can get the results via `output/my_result.txt` generated by the `--output` switch

## More features
- Write custom payload to socket (inspired by pnscan :bowtie:)
```
$ ./binoculo --range 192.168.101.1/24 -p 80 --output result.txt -w "GET / HTTP/1.1"
```

- Save only matching criteria (inspired by pnscan :bowtie:)
```
$ ./binoculo --range 192.168.101.1/24 -p 80 --output result.txt -w "HEAD / HTTP/1.1" -r "Apache"
```

### Meilisearch integration ⭐
```
$ ./binoculo --meili
```

The command above launches a meilisearch container!

_You can now access `localhost:7700` to get results via meilisearch_
