Binoculo is a lightning-fast banner grabbing tool built with Elixir, designed to swiftly retrieve service banners from target hosts. With its high-speed functionality, Binoculo efficiently collects service information across multiple ports, aiding in network reconnaissance and analysis.

## Requirements
- Docker
- Optional: Elixir to run via your host machine

## Features

Fast Network Scanning
> Utilize the enhanced multi-process task functionality in Binoculo for rapid network scans. Leverage concurrent processing to swiftly gather information across numerous hosts and ports, providing quick insights into your network's services.

Search engines Integration
> Seamlessly integrate Binoculo with Meilisearch (current), enabling lightning-fast search capabilities over your scan results. Index and query your collected data with Meilisearch's powerful search engine, enabling efficient retrieval of network service information.

WIP - Specific Banner Searches
> Perform targeted searches for specific service banners. Refine your queries to focus on precise service types or versions, streamlining your network reconnaissance efforts.

WIP - HTTP Write (pnscan inspired)
> Send commands over HTTP to communicate with services and perform actions, enhancing your network exploration capabilities

A banner grabbing tool

USAGE:
    Binoculo [-v] --range host_notation --port port(s) [--output output]
    Binoculo --version
    Binoculo --help

FLAGS:

    -v        Verbosity level                                                   

OPTIONS:

    -r, --range         CIDR or IP range: 192.168.1.0/24 or                     
                        192.168.1.0..192.168.1.255                              
    -p, --port          Port(s) to scan: 80,443,8080 or 80-8080 or 21,80-8080   
    -o, --output        Output file                                                                                      
```

## Usage
There is a "binoculo" bash script that you can run:

- Start meilisearch container
- Start front dashboard to filter and visualize results
- Run binoculo via docker for ease of use

**The command below runs via docker**
```
$ ./binoculo -r 192.168.101.1/24 -p 21,22 --output my_result.txt
```

Finishing the scan you can get the results via `output/my_result.txt` generated by the `--output` switch

## More features

- You can get/filter the results via a dashboard (wip) using the `--dashboard` flag:
```
$ ./binoculo -r 192.168.101.1/24 -p 21,22 --output my_result.txt --dashboard
```

Finishing the scan above visit `localhost:3000` to see a page with the results (collected from meilisearch)

_You can also access `localhost:7700` to get results via meilisearch (elasticsearch like)_

## Update
To update to the latest version use the command bellow:

> ./binoculo -u
